# Car Purchase Data Analysis
# Workflow
- Data Collection: Obtain the dataset containing information about users, including their gender, age, annual salary, and purchase history.
- Data Cleaning: Use pandas to handle any missing values and remove unnecessary columns. Convert categorical variables, such as gender, into numerical equivalents for analysis.
- Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests to explore relationships between variables. Use methods such as correlation analysis, t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests to analyze the data.
- Data Visualization: Visualize the data using plotly.express to gain insights and explore patterns in the dataset. Create plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.
- Machine Learning: Apply machine learning techniques to predict user purchases based on demographic and financial factors. Train supervised regression models, such as linear regression and logistic regression, to predict purchase likelihood.
- Results Interpretation: Interpret the results of the statistical analysis and machine learning models. Discuss any significant findings, insights, or trends discovered during the analysis process.
- Documentation: Document the entire workflow in a GitHub readme file to provide a clear overview of the project, including its objectives, methodology, and results.
